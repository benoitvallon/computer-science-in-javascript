# Data Structures in JavaScript (ES5 and ES6)

This repository is part of a series of posts about data structures reimplemented in JavaScript that I made [on my blog](http://blog.benoitvallon.com).

# About the #data-structures series

The [#data-structures series](http://blog.benoitvallon.com/category/data-structures-in-javascript) is a collection of posts about reimplemented data structures in JavaScript.

If you are not familiar with data structures, a quick introduction and the full list of reimplemented data structures can be found in the [introduction post of the series on data structures in JavaScript](http://blog.benoitvallon.com/data-structures-in-javascript/data-structures-in-javascript).

If you feel comfortable with the concept of each data structure and only want to see the code, have a look at the summary post of the series. It removes all explanations and contains only the [JavaScript code for all data structures](http://blog.benoitvallon.com/data-structures-in-javascript/data-structures-in-javascript-all-the-code) discussed in the series.
